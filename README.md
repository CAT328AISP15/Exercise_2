# Exercise_2

- Create 4 "agents". Each must be it's own class and not derivites of others. Be creative! Explore
      These agents must each have 5-6 graphics associated with them. In addition, play with color, alpha channel, 
      strokeWeight, stroke, etc
      Agents must also be able to be uniquely positioned.
      
- Give each agent a different ability to move around the screen. Perhaps it's only under certain conditions that the agent moves. Think of mouse input, key input and proximity to other agents. If something is moving without input, consider how that input can change over time

- Create 2 additional forces that effect the agents. Think of an occasional gust of wind that occurs on input. Or moving over a slick area of ice

- You must use vectors and classes. Comment out your code. Save this main sketch and augment the last part of the title to  also include your last names.
